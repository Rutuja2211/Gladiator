Cost Management (9 Nov 20)
--------------------------------------
-service now tool
-Azure billing/cost management monitoring
-notification to cost owners- Azure functions (based on rules-manually)
-Reserved VM instances(or to pay-as-u go)
(dynamic so reserved is not exactly worth it- Enterprise applications)
-Autoshutdown
-Unused resources(monitor+deprovision/take action)-Az Advisior used monthly
-Cleanup of orphaned disk and related objects(dangling/orphaned obj related to deleted VM)-(Policy)
       -Disks(HDD,Standard/Premium SSD)-99.5%,99.9%-SLAs
-Storage redundancy-Cosmos DB-Geo-Redundant??


-Auto-scaling(Horizontal/Vertical)
            -Vertical-increase capacity of existing hardware/software
            -Horizontal-connect multiple entities to work as single unit
	eg. -Spot instances(Bidding for resources cheaper, immediate assign-not for longer time but useful for temporary work/temporary overload)
-Archive storage???- rarely accessed resource


--------------------------------------------------
Resource Consistency

Naming conventions:
Policy to name resources in a certain way???

Any convention-but uniform overall-not too long
Clarity regarding the resources from name-not only identifyable for the person who makes them

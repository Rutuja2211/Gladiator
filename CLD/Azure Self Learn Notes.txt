CLOUD CONCEPTS:

Language of CLD:
-High Availability
-Fault Tolerance - Zero down-time
-Disaster Recovery
-Scalability-adding more resources on needs
Scaleout(more resources),scaleup(same resource bigger),scaledown
-Elasticity-Quickly able to expand or decrease computing resources. It enables scalibilty
-Agility - rapidly develop test and launch apps

Language of CLD Economics:
Consumption based pricing
Capital Expenditure
Operational Expenditure-Pay as u go

CLOUD SERVICE MODELS:
-Iaas-Servers, VMs, Networkd, Buildings
-Paas-Superset of Iaas-Middle are,Tools,BI, DBMS,etc. Support  web developmentlifecycle-building,testing,deploying, managing, updating. Avoid software license
-Saas-Includes both and build on top-Apps-Managed service.eg. Microsoft Office 365
-Serverless-Azure functions
-Shared responsibility

Azure Marketplace-App store also publish your own services

Private Cloud
Public cloud
Hybrid Cloud

AZURE ARCHITECTURE:
1.Regions-set of datacenters
-Choose a region closest to users to minimize latency(data travels fast)
-Some features not available in some rehions. Pricing also varies according to regions
*Paired region-Outage failover-Service replication

2.Availability zones-Unique physical locations within azure regions. Each zone has one or more datacenters. Each regions has min 3 zones. Physical spearation prevents data loss by data center outage(DIff centers)
Keep data in 2 zones. Automatically in other zones.

3.Resource groups- Everything is insode RG. Container that holds related resources. 
One resource only belongs to one resource group
Resources fom multiple regions in same resource group

4.Azure resource manager-Deployment and management, monitoring services for azure along with access control. Interaction with resources goes through the ARM, portal, cli, sdk, etc
Tagging and billing



COMPUTE:
1.Virtual machines-Server without exclusive hardware. Iaas.
Pricing is hourly and resource specifications like RAM or CPU
When used? Control all aspects, install specific apps or move existing resources or on prem to azure

2.Scale sets- Create and manage a group of identical load balanced VMs i.e clones your VM
When out of capacity, adds VM from scale set (automatically or as scheduled)

3.App Services- Paas-Fully managed platform-Just focus on business value and logic.3 main categories: Web apps,, web apps for containers,API apps (No UI, just connect backend)

4.Azure Container Services-
Provides all necessary dependencies such as frameworks, other software or OI interfaces in the image-Put app in the container and it will run on any machine. Have many containers on same machine or VM and each container is a single self-contained application
Make an appn using SDC, thein its placed in a container and then deployed in azure container instances (ACI)-Service to host workloads in a container

5.Azure Kubernetes Service-manage many containers at once.(K8s) Open source container orchestration system for automating application deployment,scaling,management
Replicate container architecture, standard azure services included

Azure container registry(ACR)-track of currennt valid container images, manage associated files known as artifacts
AKS-cluster-set of machines nodes
Pods is a group of containers
AKS cluster->Nodes or VMs->Pods hosted in nodes->One or more containers

6.Windows Virtual Desktop

7.Functions
Smallest compute service
single function, called using URL
Runs once and stops-1 unit of compute
Use VMs at back, its serverless, just focus on functionality
